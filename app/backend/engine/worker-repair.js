/*
 * Bring a live rental's stratum username back in line with the current naming rule.
 *
 * `worker_name` is written once, at creation, and every later re-point (DuckDNS, endpoint
 * repair) re-sends the stored string verbatim. So a rental created under an older rule
 * keeps that name for its whole paid duration, and upgrading Pickhash does nothing for
 * the rentals already running.
 *
 * That is expensive in one specific way. The old `<worker_base>-r<id>` form is accepted
 * by Ocean but not parsed by Convoy: the connection authorises, work is served, MRR
 * records full delivery — and the shares are credited to nobody, because the dash left
 * the pool with no address it could read. Nothing in the delivery path can see it. From
 * MRR's side the rental is healthy, so under-delivery never fires, no refund is due, and
 * the only symptom is hashrate missing from a pool dashboard the app never reads.
 *
 * Waiting for the next rental is therefore not good enough — the money is being spent
 * now. This re-points any active rental whose stored username is not what
 * `endpoints.rentalWorker` would produce today, carrying the stored password through so a
 * per-rig difficulty is not reset on the way past.
 *
 * Any mismatch, not just the old dash form: the same drift happens if the saved endpoint's
 * address changes under a running session, and that case has the identical symptom of
 * paying for hashrate credited to an address the user no longer uses. A rental on a pool
 * that was working keeps working — a worker rename costs a reconnect, and pools credit the
 * address, not the label.
